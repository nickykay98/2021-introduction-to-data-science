# 2021 Introduction to Data Science
Introduction to Data Science - Microsoft Student Accelerator Program 2021

## Agenda
This workshop will cover foundational topics as an introduction to data science. We aim that by the end of this workshop, you will be better prepared for subsequent MSA phases later in the year.

We will be covering the following topics:
* Pandas, Jupyter, and scikit-learn
* Data cleaning
* Regression, classification, and cross-validation
* Data visualisation with Microsoft Power BI

Each topic covered in this workshop has their own folder in this repository which houses the content and goes into detail of the learning outcomes.
